# Missing-Person Finder using face-api

Website to find and identify missing person using face-api. 
Firstly the user has to make an account, then after that he/she has to report a person that is missing by clicking on **Report Person** button on Nav bar.
Then he has to enter the details of that person and upload the images of the person to be searched.
Since I didn't have access of any Traffic Cameras, therefore here I have used my webcam as source for my video.
